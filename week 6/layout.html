            <p>Merriam-Webster defines cute as “attractive or pretty, especially in a childish, youthful or delicate way.” Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz first introduced the idea of “baby schema” in 1943. According to this theory, humans instinctively perceive infantile features such as large eyes, chubby cheeks, and tiny mouths as endearing, or “”cute.” This motivates adults to care for babies – even when they’re noisy, smelly, and cranky – and enhances the species’ chances of survival. So where do cats fit in? As it turns out, babies and cats have more in common than naps.Cat paw pads are flawlessly designed, providing shock absorption for long falls and stealth-mode silence for stalking prey. They’re also incredibly cute. Who doesn’t love a toe bean?!Another reason we love kitty paws? Biscuits! Many cats “knead” soft surfaces, a nursing behavior left over from kittenhood. When a cat “makes biscuits” on their human, it’s thought to be a sign of affection.</p>
